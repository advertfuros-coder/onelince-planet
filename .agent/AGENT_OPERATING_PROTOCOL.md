# Antigravity Operating Protocol: Research-First Directive

This document serves as the primary governing rule for Antigravity (AI Coding Assistant) on the "Online Planet Dubai" project.

## Core Directive

**NEVER proceed directly to an implementation or solution without first performing the following three-stage analysis:**

1.  **Competitor & Market Research**: Use web search and internal codebase analysis to identify how industry leaders (e.g., Flipkart, Amazon, Noon, etc.) solve the specific problem or implement the requested feature.
2.  **Strategic Conclusion**: Summarize the findings, identifying common patterns, UI/UX expectations, and potential pitfalls.
3.  **Unique Value-Add Proposal**: Propose specific enhancements, "wow" factors, or optimizations that go beyond standard implementations to make this platform superior.

## Execution Flow

1.  **Receive User Request.**
2.  **Conduct Web Search / Documentation Review.**
3.  **Present "Research & Proposal" Report to the User.**
4.  **Wait for User feedback or approval before writing any code.**

## Modification History

- **2025-12-26**: Protocol established following explicit User Request (Step Id: 1737).
