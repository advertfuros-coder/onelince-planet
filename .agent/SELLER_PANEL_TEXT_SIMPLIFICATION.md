## Impact Summary

### Before:

- Heavy use of technical jargon (telemetry, orchestration, nodes, terminals, matrices)
- Complex terminology (neural, synchronize, protocol, integrity)
- Developer/engineer-focused language
- Confusing for non-technical sellers

### After:

- Simple, everyday business language
- Clear action-oriented terms
- Seller-friendly descriptions
- Easy to understand at a glance

## Key Improvements

1. **Clarity**: Replaced all technical jargon with straightforward terms
2. **Consistency**: Used common business terminology throughout
3. **Accessibility**: Made the interface understandable for sellers with any background
4. **Action-Oriented**: Changed button labels to clearly indicate what they do
5. **User-Friendly**: Simplified descriptions and help text

## Testing Recommendations

1. Have actual sellers test the new terminology
2. Gather feedback on clarity and ease of use
3. Monitor support tickets to see if confusion has decreased
4. Consider A/B testing with different user groups

## Future Considerations

- Continue monitoring user feedback
- Update any remaining technical terms in other seller panel pages
- Create a style guide for consistent terminology across the platform
- Consider adding tooltips for any remaining complex concepts
